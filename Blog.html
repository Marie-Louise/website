    <p>Abel wanted to a tradition marriage with tradition wife.along time i wandered why he ever<br>
        married a woman like my mom in the first place,as she was the opposite of that in every way.<br>
  For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that
   in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back  being
   raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman
  “He’s like an exotic bird collector,”
  she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.</p>
  <p>my mother loathed every moment of being there.for Abel,a first born son who was</br>
    bringing home his own first born son,this trip was ahuge deal.in the homelands,the firstborn son almost becames the father/husband<br>
    by default because the dad is off working in the city.my mom ran down the hally to the kitchen,where she discovered the kitchen on fire.<br>
    Abel had driven home drunk,blind drunk,drunker than we would ever seen him before.</p>
</div>
<p2>Abel had to get his cars out.same one was taking over the property;there were liens against</br>
    his as sets .that when he started running his workshop out of our yards.it was a mess.
    Abel stopped to see what was wrong with the gun. my mather jumped up in a panic.she shoved him aside</br>
    ran for the car,jumped into the drivers seat. and Abel said Isaac ran over to Andrew,</p>
    and Andrew held him.then Abel raised his gun and he stated shooting.my mather jumped</br>
    in front of the gun to protect every one,and that is when she took the first bullet</br>
    not in herleg but t cheek.she collapsed,and as she fell to ground she screamed</p>
    Miraculously, Patricia sustains only minor injuries, and the incident reaffirms the deep love between mother and son.</br>
     Unfortunately, Abel is able to avoid jail time and goes on to live as a free man, having served only parole.</p>
     </p>Trevor's mother, Patricia Noah, is born into a Black South African family that belongs to the Xhosa tribe.</br> 
     After her parents' divorce and her father goes to live with his second wife and new family,</br> 
     Patricia grows up feeling neglected as the middle child of a working-class single mother.</br>
     By this time, tensions between Trevor and Abel have led Trevor to move into his own apartment. </br>
     The relationship between Patricia and Abel has deteriorated, and he is hoping that his mother will leave Abel entirely.</br> 
     Trevor is devastated when he finds out that Patricia is pregnant again, and he spends less time with his mother and younger brothers after this. 
     When he is in his early twenties, his career starts to take off, giving him other things to focus on. When Trevor is twenty-four,</br>
      his mother encourages him to seek out his estranged father, Robert. Trevor tracks down Robert and begins to rebuild a relationship with him.</br>
       Patricia also eventually leaves Abel and remarries.</p>
